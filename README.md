# dotfiles

Here's a bunch of settings for the [various tools I
use](https://nickjanetakis.com/blog/the-tools-i-use). I also have a number of
[blog posts and
videos](https://nickjanetakis.com/blog/tag/dev-environment-tips-tricks-and-tutorials)
related to my dev environment. There's also this documentation to help you get
everything installed and configured.

## Screenshots

Since my dotfiles are constantly evolving and I tend to reference them in
videos, blog posts and various social media posts I thought it would be a good
idea to include a screenshot of each theme I used and how to switch to it.

I prefer using themes that have good contrast ratios and are clear to see in
video recordings. These dotfiles currently support easily switching between
[Gruvbox Community](https://github.com/gruvbox-community/gruvbox) and
[One](https://github.com/rakr/vim-one) but you can use any theme you'd like.

#### Theme progression

- January 2021 (Gruvbox Community)
- April 2020 (One)
- December 2018 (Gruvbox Community)

### Themes

These dotfiles include a `set-theme` script that you can run from your terminal
to set your theme to any of the themes listed below. This script takes care of
configuring your terminal, tmux, Vim and FZF's colors in 1 command.

If you don't like the included themes that's no problem. You can use whatever
you want, there's no limitations. You could choose to manually change the
colors or [adjust the set-theme
script](#how-to-add-custom-themes-to-the-set-theme-script) to add a custom
theme.

Ater installing these dotfiles you can run this from your terminal:

```sh
# Switch to a supported theme.
# Theme names are listed below near the screenshots.
# You can also run set-theme --help to see a list of themes.
set-theme [theme_name]

# Switch between dark and light backgrounds for the active theme.
set-theme --toggle-bg

# Switch the theme and toggle the background in 1 command.
set-theme [theme_name] --toggle-bg
```

_If you get an error about your terminal config file not being found please
review [this FAQ
item](#how-to-use-a-different-terminal-in-the-set-theme-script)._

## Quickly Get Set Up with These Dotfiles

I'm going to try my best to provide beginning to end installation instructions
for Debian, Ubuntu (native or WSL) along with macOS. Fortunately setting up
most of these tools will be the same on any OS since they're not OS specific.

### OS / distro specific installation steps

My set up targets tmux 3.0+ and Vim 8.1+. As long as you can meet those
requirements you'll be good to go.

#### Debian

If you're on Debian Buster, you'll want to enable backports for `tmux` before
installing anything. Once you do that then you can proceed to the Ubuntu 20.04
LTS installation steps below.

Any version after Buster should be good to go without any backports.

#### Ubuntu LTS

##### Ubuntu 18.04 LTS or older

In order to get Vim 8.1+ you'll want to use the PPA below.

```sh
# Run this before moving on.
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:jonathonf/vim
```

As for tmux you'll need to compile it from source to get 3.0+. If you Google
around for things like "get latest tmux for Ubuntu 18.04", you'll find
tutorials. I've even seen some for Ubuntu 16.04. Just make sure you compile
tmux 3.0+.

If you do end up compiling tmux from source, then make sure to remove tmux from
the list of packages below. Speaking of which, once you've done the above then
you can proceed to the Ubuntu 20.04 LTS installation steps below.

##### Ubuntu 20.04 LTS

It's smooth sailing if you're using 20.04 LTS or newer.

```sh
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install -y \
  curl \
  git \
  gnupg \
  htop \
  jq \
  pass \
  pwgen \
  python3-pip \
  ripgrep \
  rsync \
  shellcheck \
  tmux \
  unzip \
  vim-gtk
```

The GTK version of Vim is to get +clipboard support, we'll still run terminal
`vim` from the command line.

#### Other Linux distros

If you're not using Debian or Ubuntu that's ok. You can change the `apt`
commands above to use your distro's package manager instead. Just be mindful of
making sure you get tmux 3.0+ and Vim 8.1+.

#### macOS

I don't use a Mac but I've tracked down most of these packages in
[brew](https://brew.sh/). Feel free to open a PR if there's a better way to
install them. I haven't tested this personally but the tmux and Vim versions
are good to go based on Homebrew's docs.

```sh
brew install \
  curl \
  git \
  gnupg \
  htop \
  jq \
  pass \
  pwgen \
  python \
  ripgrep \
  rsync \
  shellcheck \
  tmux \
  unzip \
  vim
```

### Installing everything else (OS neutral)

I would make an effort to read the comments for each command before copy /
pasting them into a terminal just so you know what's getting installed. You may
want to modify some of these things based on which tools you want.

#### Install these dotfiles and various tools on your system

```sh
# Clone down this dotfiles repo to your home directory. Feel free to place
# this anywhere you want, but remember where you've cloned things to.
git clone https://github.com/alexmk92/dotfiles ~/dotfiles

# Create symlinks to various dotfiles. If you didn't clone it to ~/dotfiles
# then adjust the ln -s symlink source (left side) to where you cloned it.
#
# NOTE: The last one is WSL 1 / 2 specific. Don't do it on native Linux / macOS.

#### Optionally confirm that a few things work after closing and re-opening your terminal

```sh
# Sanity check to see if you can run some of the tools we installed.
ruby --version
node --version
ansible --version
aws --version
terraform --version

# Check to make sure git is configured with your name, email and custom settings.
git config --list

# If you're using Docker Desktop with WSL 2, these should be accessible too.
docker info
docker-compose --version
```

Before you start customizing certain config files, take a look at the
[personalization question in the FAQ](#how-to-personalize-these-dotfiles).

### Extra WSL 1 and WSL 2 steps

In addition to the Linux side of things, there's a few config files that I have
in various directories of this dotfiles repo. These have long Windows paths.

It would be expected that you copy those over to your system while replacing
"Nick" with your Windows user name if you want to use those things, such as my
Microsoft Terminal `settings.json` file and others. Some of the paths may
also contain unique IDs too, so adjust them as needed on your end.

Some of these configs expect that you have certain programs or tools installed
on Windows. The [tools I use blog
post](https://nickjanetakis.com/blog/the-tools-i-use) has a complete list of
those tools so you can pick the ones you want to install.

Pay very close attention to the `c/Users/Nick/.wslconfig` file because it has
values in there that you will very likely want to change before using it.
[This commit
message](https://github.com/nickjj/dotfiles/commit/d0f1fc2622204b809cf7fcbb1a82d45b451064c4)
goes into the details.

Also, you should reboot to activate your `/etc/wsl.conf` file (symlinked
earlier). That will be necessary if you want to access your mounted drives at
`/c` or `/d` instead of `/mnt/c` or `/mnt/d`.

## FAQ

### How to personalize these dotfiles?

Chances are you'll want to personalize some of these files, such as various Vim
settings. Since this is a git repo you can always do a `git pull` to get the
most up to date copy of these dotfiles, but then you may find yourself
clobbering over your own personal changes.

Since we're using git here, we have a few reasonable options.

For example, from within this dotfiles git repo you can run `git checkout -b personalized` and now you are free to make whatever changes that you want on
your custom branch. When it comes time to pull down future updates you can run
a `git pull origin master` and then `git rebase master` to integrate any
updates into your branch.

Another option is to fork this repo and use that, then periodically pull and
merge updates. It's really up to you.

### How to add custom themes to the set-theme script?

Prefer a video? [Here's a video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h509rn2xIyU&t=191s)
that demonstrates performing the steps below.

After installing these dotfiles you'll have a `~/.local/bin/set-theme` script.
It's a [zero dependency Python 3
script](https://github.com/nickjj/dotfiles/blob/master/.local/bin/set-theme).

1. Open the above file
2. Check out the `THEMES` dictionary near the top of the file
3. Copy one of the existing themes' dictionary items, such as `gruvbox` or `one`
4. Rename the dictionary's key to whatever your new theme's colorscheme name is in Vim
5. Adjust all of the colors and additional values in your new dictionary item as you see fit
6. Run `set-theme cooltheme`, replacing `cooltheme` with whatever name you used in step 4

Your terminal and tmux colors will update automatically, but if you have Vim
already open you'll need to manually run this command from within Vim to reload
your config `:so $MYVIMRC`.

If you added a theme with good contrast ratios please open a pull request to
get it added to the script.

### How to use a different terminal in the set-theme script?

I'm using the Microsoft Terminal but if you're using something else then your
terminal's colors won't get updated by this script because the script looks for
strings that are in MS terminal's config, but it's not painful to change.

_By the way, if you're using the Microsoft Terminal Preview edition you'll
still need to do step 1 below because the path of your MS terminal config file
will be different than the non-preview edition._

You'll want to adjust the `set-theme` script by doing this:

1. Change the `TERMINAL_CONFIG` variable to reference your terminal config's path
2. Change the `terminal` attributes in the `THEMES` dictionary to use your terminal's config option names
3. Change the regex in the `change_terminal_theme` function based on your terminal's config option formatting rules
4. Optionally install Gruvbox, One or any other themes (the MS Terminal config in this repo includes them)

### How to fix Vim taking a long time to open when inside of WSL?

It primarily comes down to either VcXsrv not running or a firewall tool
blocking access to VcXsrv and it takes a bit of time for the connection to time
out.

You can verify this by starting Vim with `vim -X` instead of `vim`. This
will prevent Vim from connecting to an X server. This also means clipboard
sharing to your system clipboard won't work, but it's good for a test.

Vim will try to connect to that X server by default because `DISPLAY` is
exported in the `.bashrc` file. Installing and configuring VcXsrv as per these
dotfiles will fix that issue.

If it still persists, it might be a software firewall issue. You can open TCP
port 6000 and also restrict access to it from only WSL 2. This will depend on
which tool you're using to configure that but that should do the trick.
